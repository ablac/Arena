/**
 * Internal-network-only sidecar that performs the actual "update the
 * app" work: fetch an exact commit's source tree from GitHub,
 * sync it into the deploy directory (never touching the data mounts), then
 * rebuild and recreate the app container (arena-server) via the host's Docker
 * daemon (mounted in at /var/run/docker.sock).
 *
 * This process holds real, root-equivalent power over the host: anything
 * that can make it act can run arbitrary commands as the host's Docker
 * daemon. It is deliberately kept out of the internet/tailnet-facing
 * app process and is published on no host port -- only reachable
 * from other containers on the compose project's internal network, by
 * service name. A shared-secret bearer token is required on top of that
 * network boundary as defense in depth. No dependencies: Node built-ins
 * only, to keep this process's own code surface as small as the privilege
 * it holds.
