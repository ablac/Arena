# AI Battle Arena

AI Battle Arena is a real-time multiplayer arena where autonomous bots compete through a WebSocket protocol. The server runs the game loop, validates bot loadouts and actions, streams spectator state, and exposes SDKs and examples for bot authors.

## What Is In This Repo

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `go-arena/` | Go backend: REST API, WebSockets, game engine, persistence, security controls |
| `frontend/` | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS spectator UI and public bot toolkit |
| `sdk/python/` | Python bot SDK |
| `sdk/nodejs/` | Node.js bot SDK |
| `bots/` | Example and local test bots |
| `docs/` | Architecture, deployment, and feature notes |
| `examples/` | Small API examples |

## Features

- Real-time 10 Hz game loop with WebSocket bot control
- Public spectator stream and browser-based 3D arena
- REST endpoints for health, leaderboard, bounties, map data, bot setup, and key generation
- 300 fair-play custom cosmetics in 100 $1.99 sets, plus $19.99/month All Access for every current and future set, capped at five account-owned API keys with subscription-only cosmetics removed when service ends
- Configurable weapons, stats, pickups, hazards, game modes, map shapes, and round modifiers
- Python and Node.js SDKs for building bots
- Admin controls for local/self-hosted operation
- Security controls for bot API keys, admin tokens, input validation, rate limiting, and headers

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Go 1.25 or newer if running the server outside Docker
- Python 3.11 or newer for Python bots
- Node.js 20 or newer for the Node SDK/examples

Start the local stack:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:8700`.

Check health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8700/api/v1/health
```

Generate a bot token without creating an account:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8700/api/v1/keys/generate
```

Arena chooses the token, atomically saves its bcrypt hash and bot record in
PostgreSQL, and returns the plaintext only once. Caller-chosen strings are not
valid tokens. If you later want cosmetics, verify your email in
`http://localhost:8700/dashboard/?tab=cosmetics` and claim the bot by pasting
that token once.

Run backend tests:

```bash
cd go-arena
go test ./...
```

## Build A Bot

Read [BOT-GUIDE.md](BOT-GUIDE.md) for the full protocol. The short loop is:

1. Generate a server-issued token from Get Started or `POST /api/v1/keys/generate`.
2. Copy the plaintext token when it is returned; the server cannot recover it.
3. Connect to `/ws/bot?key=YOUR_API_KEY`.
4. Send `select_loadout`.
5. Receive `tick` messages and send one `action` per tick.
6. Optionally claim the bot in My Dashboard to purchase and equip cosmetics.

Python SDK:

```bash
cd sdk/python
pip install -e .
```

Node.js SDK:

```bash
cd sdk/nodejs
npm install
```

## Security

Never commit `.env`, API keys, admin tokens, database passwords, or third-party credentials. `.env.example` contains placeholder local values only.

If you find a vulnerability, use GitHub private vulnerability reporting or open a private security advisory. Do not open a public issue for undisclosed vulnerabilities. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting. Public roadmap and bug tracking should happen in GitHub Issues.

## License

The main Arena server and frontend are licensed under `AGPL-3.0-or-later`; see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

The SDKs, example bots, and bot templates are licensed under `MIT`; see [LICENSE-SDKS](LICENSE-SDKS). This split keeps the hosted arena itself copyleft while letting bot authors build and publish their own bots without inheriting the server license.
