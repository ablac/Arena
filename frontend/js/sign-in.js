/**
 * Signing in, from anywhere on the site, in one press.
 *
 * Arena has exactly one way for a person to sign in: Angel Accounts. It had
 * one before this module existed too — but every control that offered it
 * opened the Dashboard drawer first, and the drawer's signed-out shell asked
 * which of two ways you wanted, so the single way took two presses to reach.
 * This module is the missing middle: a control calls `startSignIn()` and the
 * Accounts window opens, with nothing of Arena's in between.
 *
 * Why the popup must open on the press itself
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Browsers only let `window.open` through while a user gesture is still in
 * effect, and a gesture does not survive a network round trip. So this module
 * never fetches anything on the way to opening the window: it keeps the last
 * known session from `startSessionSync` (which every page already runs) and
 * reads it synchronously at press time. The one fetch here is the fallback
 * for a press that arrives before that first read has landed, which is rare
 * and degrades to `accounts-login.js`'s own same-window redirect rather than
 * to a dead click.
 *
 * Consent is not a step in the flow
 * ---------------------------------
 * The legal gate runs before the window opens, because agreement collected
 * inside a window somebody did not expect is agreement collected badly. It is
 * shown once ever, so for everybody past their first sign-in it costs a
 * microtask and no press. That is why "one click" survives it.
 *
 * Nothing here is allowed to dead-end
 * -----------------------------------
 * An Arena with no customer OIDC configured is a real state — the checked-in
 * config ships that way — and a press in that state must say so. It resolves
 * `unconfigured` with the message the Dashboard has always shown, and the
 * caller puts it where its own visitor is looking.
 *
