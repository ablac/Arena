 *
 * This is that. Pressing Sign in opens a centered window on the Accounts
 * authorization flow immediately — no Arena screen in between asking which way
 * you would like to sign in, because there is only one way now.
 *
 * Not an iframe, and that is not a shortcut
 * -----------------------------------------
 * An iframe was the owner's first suggestion and it cannot work, for two
 * independent reasons, either of which is fatal on its own:
 *
 *  - accounts.angel-serv.com sends `frame-ancestors 'none'`. Every browser
 *    refuses to render it in a frame, and that header is a correct defence
 *    against clickjacking a login form — the fix is not to weaken it.
 *  - Passkeys refuse to operate in a cross-origin frame. Even with the header
 *    relaxed, the strongest way to sign in would be the one that stopped
 *    working.
 *
 * A popup keeps the sign-in on its own origin, in a window whose address bar
 * the person can read — which is the property that makes it safe to type a
 * password into — while leaving the page behind it exactly where it was.
 *
 * The opener never sees a token
 * -----------------------------
 * The popup completes the authorization against Arena's own callback, which
 * sets the session cookie and lands on `dashboard/signed-in.html`. That page
 * posts one bare notification back. No code, no token, and nothing worth
 * intercepting crosses `postMessage` — the opener reacts by asking the server
 * who it is now, which is the only answer that can be trusted anyway.
