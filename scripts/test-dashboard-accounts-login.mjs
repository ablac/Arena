/**
 * Signing in is one press of one control, and it opens a window.
 *
 * This replaces test-dashboard-email-auth.mjs, which asserted the shape of a
 * feature that no longer exists — Arena's own passwordless email sign-in. That
 * test passing after the feature was retired would have been worse than no
 * test: a green guard around a dead path.
 *
 * What is checked here is the part that is easy to get wrong and impossible to
 * see in a screenshot: that the popup is opened directly by the press, that
 * the message it waits for is checked for origin *and* source, that a blocked
 * popup preserves the game and offers a retry, and that nothing sensitive crosses the
 * window boundary.
