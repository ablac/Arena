/*
 * Reading whether somebody subscribes, at the one moment Arena is allowed to.
 *
 * Arena holds no credential for the Accounts API. It never stores the access
 * token from a sign-in, and it does not ask for `offline_access`, so there is
 * no refresh token either — which means the only moment Arena can read
 * entitlements is the few hundred milliseconds it is holding a freshly minted
 * token in the callback, before that token goes out of scope for good.
 *
 * That is a deliberate trade, not an oversight. The alternative is a durable
 * credential for every customer sitting in Arena's database: a table that is
 * worth stealing, has to be encrypted at rest, has to be revoked on sign-out,
 * and grows a rotation problem. Reading once per sign-in avoids all of it, and
 * signing in is already one click.
 *
 * What it costs is freshness. Somebody who subscribes in the Accounts app and
 * comes straight back does not see it until the next read. Two things close
 * that gap, and the second is not built here:
 *
 *   - Signing in again. One click, no password on a live Accounts session, and
 *     it re-reads. The Dashboard offers exactly this, labelled for what it does.
 *   - A subscription event on the Accounts webhook outbox, which pushes the
 *     news rather than waiting to be asked. That is the right long-term answer
 *     and it needs Arena's service client provisioned and the outbox signature
 *     scheme, neither of which exists yet.
 *
 * What is read is one paid-cosmetics bit: a legacy Arena subscription row
 * uses its `active` flag; an included base row uses only its verified Arena
 * subscription upgrade's `active` flag. Included access alone grants no paid look. Arena sells nothing per item any more, so there is no
 * purchase ledger to reconcile — the flag is written on the account and every
 * paid cosmetic is unlocked or hidden by it at read time.
